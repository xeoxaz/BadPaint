# Not so bad paint
*formally known as "BadPaint"*

## Xeoxaz's Revision
I took my skills to update this to a more full version of what it really could be!

## Description:
`BadPaint is a basic paint program written in C#`
[Original](https://github.com/Hri7566/BadPaint)

## Options Window
I moved all the options to their own window.

## Loading / Saving
*I did not change the load, or save functionality.*

## Resizing
I allowed the program to be resizable at anymoment.

## Credits & Acknowledgements
